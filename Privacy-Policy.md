# Privacy Policy

*Last updated: January 02, 2019*

EtherAddressLookup values your privacy and security and actively works to collect as little of your personal data and information as possible.

This document ("Privacy Policy") explains how EtherAddressLookup collects, stores, uses, handles and protects personal information collected, if any.


### Information Collected

EtherAddressLookup doesn't aim to collect or store any of your personal information - it has no use to us.

#### Warning Block Page

Before v1.19 was published (December 03, 2018), we collected anonymous user information on the warning block view via Google Analytics. Since we have moved the warning block view to become part of the extension, we have removed the Goolge Analytics. 

During that time, the information was used solely to check where redirects were coming from to monitor takedown reports more effectively. We also monitoried hits by country - but now we do not.

*We do not use Google Analytics on this function anymore.*

#### Google Chrome Extension Store

We have injected Google Analytics into the Google Chrome extension store (as their functionality provides). We use this to track the number of installs per country to see if we need to start offering internationalization/translations. This is all anonymous data and does not personally identify you.

#### 3rd Parties

We use GitHub (https://github.com) and Infura (https://infura.io) servers to host our blacklists & whitelists. EtherAddressLookup will pull these lists every ~10minutes in the background client side so your IP address may be recorded by them. 

Everytime you navigate a page or domain in your browser and have the "Warn of blacklisted domains" option enabled, the domain is checked against your local copy of the lists that is stored in the browsers `LocalStorage`.
